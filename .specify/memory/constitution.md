# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation using Docusaurus, deployed on GitHub Pages Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
Accuracy in all technical explanations (Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, CLI steps, deployment). All instructions must be verified through official documentation or reliable sources.

### II. Clarity
Beginner-friendly clarity for students with basic web development knowledge. Writing style: simple English, easy for beginners.

### III. Reproducibility
Every step must be repeatable with commands clearly shown. Code examples must be tested and runnable.

### IV. Practical Focus
Real project workflow, no unnecessary theory.

### V. Structure and Format
Structure must follow a proper book format (chapters, sections, code blocks). Output format: Markdown files structured for Docusaurus. Book length: 8–12 chapters. Each chapter must include: explanation + example + practice task.

### VI. Originality and Verification
No plagiarism — all content must be original. Screenshots described; alt-text included. Project must build successfully.

## Tools

Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code.

## Key Standards

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance.
