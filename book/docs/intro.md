# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Hackathon Book! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fundamentals of controlling humanoid robots using artificial intelligence in both simulated and real-world environments. This expanded edition now covers 12 comprehensive chapters to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics.

## Overview

This book is designed for university-level students, AI enthusiasts, and educators who want to explore the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence. You'll learn how to integrate ROS 2, simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action models to create intelligent humanoid robots capable of navigating, perceiving, and manipulating objects based on voice commands.

## What You'll Learn

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Understanding the Robot Operating System 2 architecture and how to create basic robotic applications
- **Digital Twin Technology**: Creating and interacting with digital twins of humanoid robots in simulation environments
- **AI-Robot Brain**: Developing advanced AI techniques for robot control using NVIDIA Isaac
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Implementing systems that convert voice commands into robot actions
- **Path Planning and Navigation**: Advanced navigation techniques for humanoid robots
- **Computer Vision**: Perception systems for robotic applications
- **Manipulation and Grasping**: Techniques for robotic manipulation and object handling
- **Multi-Robot Coordination**: Collaborative robotics and team-based operations
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Machine learning techniques for robotic systems
- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Social robotics and natural human-robot interfaces
- **Safety and Ethics**: Safety considerations and ethical frameworks for robotics
- **Future Trends**: Emerging technologies and applications in humanoid robotics
